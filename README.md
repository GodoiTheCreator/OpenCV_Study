# OpenCV_Study
My studies about OpenCV for a school project, I'll put them here to save.
To this studies I split them into chapters, according to the author of this course that I watched.
Some of the code parts are commented because I was changing filters or changing features to test them, so it's not a formal document!
I just did this to work in my science's fair projetc, wich I worked using OpenCV and AI, in Python.
I hope it's understandable, if someone see this one day!
Enjoy!
